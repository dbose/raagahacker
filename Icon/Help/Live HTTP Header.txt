Hi William,

Thanks for your post. As I understand, you want to view the request
information being sent from IE or WebBrowser Control. Please correct me if
there is any misunderstanding. There are several methods we can use:

1. There is a C# HTTP client sample which demonstrates how to use .NET
networking classes. It will list the header/cookie information in details.
Please check it on your side:

SAMPLE: Visual C# .NET Networking Classes HTTP Internet Client
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q303436

2. You can also enable logging in IIS which will log the cookie information
in a log file. Please refer to the following MSDN article:

Customizing W3C Extended Logging

dard/proddocs/en-us/log_customw3c.asp

3. For WebBrowser ActiveX control, it exposes the IWebBrowser2 interface,
which lets you control the browser. The IWebBrowser2 interface lets you
retrieve an interface pointer to the current HTML document (IHTMLDocument2)
from which you can get cookie:

eference/ifaces/document2/cookie.asp

I'd like to recommend you HTTP Specification which you can access at
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html.

In addition, since you are using 3rd-party wwHTTP, I suggest that you can
also contact www.West-Wind.com for detailed information on using wwHTTP.

Hope this helps.
